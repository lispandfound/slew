{-| Tail a file, while keeping an internal state.

    If the file doesn't exist, `tailFile` will poll for it until it is found.

    If `tailFile` detects the file has been moved or renamed, it goes back to
    watching a file with the original name.

    `tailFile` also detects file truncations, in which case it starts reading
    again from the beginning.

    Data already existing in the file before `tailFile` is invoked is ignored.
