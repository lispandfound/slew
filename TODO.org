#+title: Slew Project TODO
* Backlog
** TODO Log shell command outputs
** TODO Report shell command errors

* Roadmap
**  Tier 0 — Core SLURM Features
*** DONE Job table
Reusable component with focus state, scroll offset, and filtered data in Model
*** DONE Job Table Filtering
*** DONE Job Table Sorting
*** DONE Job details
Modal or split-pane detail view conditionally shown in View based on selected job
*** DONE Cancel job
Msg triggered on keypress, update triggers external IO via Cmd (calls scancel)
** Tier 1 — Low-Hanging UX Wins
*** TODO Automatic Release Builds
*** TODO Resubmit/clone job
Pressing key → emit Msg → handler constructs sbatch string and spawns a Cmd
*** TODO Export to CSV
Cmd that writes to file or clipboard, possibly triggered by Msg
*** TODO Log preview (tail)
Use Cmd to spawn tail process → output read into Msg → render in scrollable window
*** TODO Pending reason
On select or hover, fetch with Cmd, cached in state (Map JobId Reason)
** Tier 2 — Interactive and Composable
*** TODO Live CPU/RAM on Job
Background polling Cmd, updating state (e.g., Map JobId ResourceUsage)
*** TODO Job status timeline
Maintain a timestamped event log per job in model, render as a bar/timeline
*** TODO Sbatch templates
Managed like "named presets", a list of templates in model, pick with a list view
*** TODO File outputs
Use job metadata to show clickable filenames or paths → render preview on select
*** TODO Interactive search bar
Composable widget (like textbox) → on change, updates filter state in parent
** Tier 3 — State-Rich Components
*** TODO Cluster grid view
A 2D grid component with zoom/pan, node states loaded via Cmd, decoupled from job list
*** TODO Usage heatmap
Render calendar view from usage data (precomputed by Cmd, lives in model)
*** TODO Group/team view
Swap filter preset based on SLURM account/group → all filters as pure functions in Model
*** TODO Scrollable log with ANSI
Treat like a buffer with scroll offset, parse ANSI sequences into colored spans
*** TODO Job leaderboard
Sort + reduce over all jobs/users → render summary table (pure function)
** Tier 4 — Smarter Features
*** TODO "Why is job pending?"
Diagnostic engine as pure function; present output in modal or side pane
*** TODO Job suggestions
Offline job history as lookup table → analyzed in Update, surfaced on select
*** TODO Plugin system
Dynamically load components or handlers from config or external executables (shell hook Cmds)
*** TODO Command mode (:)
Modal textbox with its own parser → emits structured Msg like :cancel 12345
*** TODO Auto-sbatch generation
Parse old job → build sbatch string from state → use preview modal before submit
** Tier 5 — Delightful Extras
*** TODO SLURM message inbox
Background poll + cached messages in state (simple list view with read/unread flags)
*** TODO Shell into node
Emits Cmd to srun --jobid, spawns subshell or informs user
*** TODO Node fit visualiser
On job select → compute constraints → map to node grid and render fit indicators
